# Problem: Sort an Array

## Description
Given an array of integers `nums`,  
sort the array in **ascending order**.

You must solve the problem without using built-in sort functions (for algorithmic understanding).

## Pattern
Sorting / Divide and Conquer

## Difficulty
Medium

## Approach
1. Use an efficient sorting algorithm such as **Merge Sort**.
2. Recursively divide the array into halves.
3. Sort each half independently.
4. Merge the sorted halves to obtain the final sorted array.

## Time Complexity
O(n log n)

## Space Complexity
O(n)

## Platform
