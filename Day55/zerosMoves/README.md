# 📌 Problem: Zero Moves

## Description
Given an integer array,  
determine the minimum number of moves required to make all elements equal to zero based on the operations defined in the problem.

Each move modifies elements according to the given constraints.

## Pattern
Array / Greedy / Simulation

## Difficulty
Medium

## Approach
1. Traverse the array and analyze how each element can be reduced to zero.
2. Apply the allowed operation optimally to minimize total moves.
3. Track the number of moves required for each element.
4. Accumulate the total number of moves.
5. Return the final count.
