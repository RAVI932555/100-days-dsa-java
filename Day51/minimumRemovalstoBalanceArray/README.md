# 📌 Problem: Minimum Removals to Balance Array

## Description
Given an integer array,  
determine the **minimum number of elements to remove** so that the array becomes balanced based on the problem’s defined condition.

A balanced array satisfies the required constraint after removals.

## Pattern
Array / Greedy / Counting

## Difficulty
Medium

## Approach
1. Analyze the condition required for the array to be balanced.
2. Count or track elements that violate the balance condition.
3. Determine which elements need to be removed to satisfy the constraint.
4. Minimize removals by keeping the maximum valid elements.
5. Return the number of removed elements.
